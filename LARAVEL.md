# What is Laravel?

Laravel is an open-source PHP framework designed to make developing web apps easier and faster through built-in features. These features are part of what makes Laravel so widely used by web developers:


- A modular packaging system with dependency management. This means you can easily add functionalities to your Laravel app without writing them from scratch. You can either create your own packages for code you routinely use or install ready-to-use packages through Composer.
- A complete authentication system
- Object-relational mapping. Eloquent ORM included with Laravel presents database tables as classes for easier data access and manipulation.
- A command-line interface (CLI) that comes with dozens of pre-built commands (Artisan).
- Automatic testing. Automated tests are provided as an integral part of Laravel.
- A portable, virtual development environment. Homestead provides developers with all the tools necessary to develop Laravel straight out of the box.

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Laravel:

#### Advantages of Laravel:

- New features of PHP can be used. The biggest advantage of the Laravel framework over the others is that it utilizes all the new features of the PHP. Most of the other frameworks are unable to do it. By using the Laravel 5, you are able to use many new features that are provided by PHP like Interfaces, overloading, Shorter array syntax, Namespaces, Anonymous functions.
- Great documentation. It is believed that Laravel is develop-friendly due to documentation. All the version of the Laravel is discharged with the proper documentation in which you are able to find good and detailed explanations of classes, coding style, methods.  
- Integration with mail services. It is very compulsory for web applications to stay in touch with the users and inform them about the new deals and offers. The framework is equipped with API rather than the SwiftMailer library. It also provides the drivers SMTP, Mailgun, SparkPost, Mandrill, PHP’s “mail” function, Amazon SES, and “send email” which helps you in sending the emails through the local services or cloud-based.
- Supports popular cache backends. One of the more adventitious features is that it supports Memcached and Redis out-of-the-box.
- Artisan. It is very difficult to do the repetitive programming tasks which are heavily time-consuming. Artisan is the command-line tool that helps in creating the skeleton code and runs the database system strongly.
- Packages and resource availability. You can take advantage of npm packages and bower packages by connecting the framework with elixir and Gulp. It is very beneficially in resource and asset revisioning. Moreover, this combined with the composer will sort out dependencies and therefore it is the most stable source of the package in the PHP world.
- A reduced product development cycle. As the integrations are faster it is possible to reduce the product development cycle. Also, you are provided with huge community support and have the assistance of Laracasts.
- IoC Container. IoC is referred to as the inversion of Control. It is used for generating new objects without bootstrap any external libraries. Simply put, you are able to access these objects from where you are coding, you don't need to deal with inflexible monolithic structures.
- Reverse Routing. It is also the most beautiful feature of Laravel. In this, you are able to create links to named routes. It is very easy for the users to create the links, just simply use the route's name, and the framework will automatically insert the correct URL. If the user changes the route, the change will occur everywhere.
- Active Record Implementation. This is one of the most useful features in the framework in which it gives an easy and very helpful ActiveRecord implementation for running with your database. Put differently, it intends that the models you build in the MVC will have a corresponding table in the database.

#### Disadvantages of Laravel:

- The Composer is not strong enough. As Laravel is a new framework, therefore it is difficult for developers to deal with it. Also, the composer of Laravel is not strong enough in comparison with Ruby gems, npm (node.js), pip (for python), etc.
- Lack of continuation between versions. No transition from Laravel 4 to 5 has seemed. It could break the application if you try to update the code.
- Quality is mixed at times. There are some components in the framework which are not well-designed. For instance, sometimes dependency injection becomes needlessly complex. You have to learn a lot before you start to create applications.
- Some upgrades might be problematic. It is not only a Laravel problem but also PHP frameworks that show some troubles when the version is upgraded. So, the user has to take care of the precautions before updating the version.
- Development. If we check the development of other frameworks, we found out that their development is quite faster in contrast with Laravel.
